In this project we have used a new concept , that is called Throttling.
Throttling :-> Throttling ensures that the function is not called more often than a specified time interval. There are different ways to implement throttling in JavaScript, but the two most common methods involve using the setTimeout function or the requestAnimationFrame function.

Process of making project in js :
1) Every time make a div.
2) Do, absolute the div , give width,height and also overflow:hidden.
3) Make image in the div and push the image beneath the div.
4) Animated the image : way to upper and pop.
